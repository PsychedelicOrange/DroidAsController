Turns Wired Gamepad into Wireless using Android.
Have to plug your gaming pc to the tv, want to play in the couch, but don't have a wireless controller ?

## How it works
* Android acts as a usb host for the controller, gets data from controller and sends it to pc wirelesslly over tcp channel
* Pc gets the data and feeds it to vJoy,a virtual controller software.
* x360ce makes any device act as a xbox 360 controller, we can map our buttons and axis correctly using x360ce , Alternatively mapping can be done in steam big picture mode.

## Use 
* [Download](https://github.com/PsychedelicOrange/DroidAsController/releases)
* Install App on android device. 
* Download and install [java](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows), [vJoy](https://github.com/shauleiz/vJoy), and optionally [x360ce](https://github.com/x360ce/x360ce).
* Connect the phone and pc to same wifi.
* Notedown IP of the pc and enter in the app.
* Connect your controller to the phone and give permission to the app. 

## Project IN PROGRESS, but working
* Feel free to report bugs and leave suggestions in Issues tab
* Refer to Resources.

## NOTES
* If you want the app to open [automatically](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/usb/host#using-intents) after your controller is connected, note down the product and vendor id , add it to xml/device_filter.xml
